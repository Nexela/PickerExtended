# Picker Extended!  Now with pipette extension

## Extended version of the picker mod by Tinyboss

### Picker ghost revivier

Hover over a ghost and use the Factorio pipette tool to pick the entity that places it. Press the pipette tool button again to revive the ghost. Reviving a ghost keeps all of its settings and module requests. Picker extended will also try and fill module slots of revived ghosts if they have requests. Hover over any damanged entity and press CONTROL+Q with nothing in your hands to grab a repair tool from your inventory. Hover over any item request proxy and press Q to search your inventory for the requested modules/items and insert them.
Recomend using this with the same keybinds as clean cursor and pipette tool. Picker extend can also pick up selected items on the ground and put it in your hands.

Hover any any ghost entity with the item in your hand and it will automatically revive it.
